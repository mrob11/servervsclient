# servervsclient

This project explores the differences between Server Components and Client Components in Next.js 15. It demonstrates how data fetching, interactivity, and rendering behavior vary between the two paradigms using simple, side-by-side examples.

Features include:

- Server-side and client-side data fetching comparisons
- Usage of React Server Components (RSC) with free public APIs
- Server Actions vs traditional client mutation patterns
- Caching, streaming, and loading behavior demos

Ideal for developers looking to deepen their understanding of Next.js 15â€™s App Router and how to think in terms of server-first architecture.
